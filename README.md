# Lazy-Susan
An emulator of a motorised lasy susan

This program is a text-based emulator of a motorised lazy Susan. Since I am yet to make a functioning lazy Susan, in the meantime I have made this program. It asks who is requesting the item, then what item they want, then reports back what the table is doing.
