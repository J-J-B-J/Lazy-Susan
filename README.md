# Lazy-Susan
An emulator of a motorised lasy susan

This program is a text-based emulator of a motorised lazy Susan. Since I am yet to make a functioning lazy Susan, in the meantime I have made this program. It asks who is requesting the item, then what item they want, then reports back what the table is doing.

### UPDATE: V1.1
- Issue resolved: When the table should only turn anticlockwise, it turns clockwise and anticlockwise

### UPDATE: V1.2
- You can now "Enable" or "Disable" table objects if you take them off your lazy Susan

### UPDATE: V1.3
- The code for getting the modifier for each person is now a function
- The program checks for validity whenever it asks for user input
- Prints an appropriate error message upon invalid user input
- Prints the items that are on the table whenever there is a change to them

### UPDATE: V1.4
- All old delay functions changed to Python Standard time.sleep
- More comments added
- All lines longer than 79 characters shortened
